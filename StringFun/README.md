# String Fun - Project 4

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to give you some practice working with and manipulating strings

## Details
Write a function called string_fun that does the following:
* Declare a variable that holds your full name (first and last) and initialize it to your name.
* Prompt the user to guess your name (first last)
* Display a message saying whether or not the entered name matches your name
* Return the entered name

Write another function called no_vowels that takes in the guessed name as a string and does the following:
* Removes all vowels and does not destroy the original string
* Returns the vowel-less name
* Vowels must be completely removed, not replaced with blanks

Lastly, use f-strings to store the entered name with the text “ the Barbarian”, storing the result into a well-named variable, then print the result.

## Sample Output

The output of each section should look like this:

Guess my name (first last): Conan Obrien

Nice try, but incorrect

You guessed Conan Obrien
Without vowels, that's Cnn brn

And in less civilized times, it would be Conan Obrien the Barbarian

## Technical Details

- Name your program string_fun.py
- Include a block at the top of your code that has your name, date, and description of the what the program does.

As with all programs written in this course, maintainability is as important as functionality, so your code should be clear and easy to follow.  Make sure it follows the class coding conventions, and double check your code against this checklist before submitting.
