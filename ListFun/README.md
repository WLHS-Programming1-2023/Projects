# List Fun - Project 5
The purpose of this assignment is to get some experience working with lists in Python

## Overview

Write a program (named list_fun) that gets 10 integers from the user, stores them in an list, and then prints out:
* the entire list
* the lowest value in the list (don't use built-in functions)
* the highest value in the list (don't use built-in functions)
* the number of odd numbers in the list
* the sum of all the values in the list.
* all the values that appear in the list more than once


## Details
You must write/use the following functions (youâ€™ll need to determine the parameter(s) and return for each): 
* get_data() - fills in a list with data entered by the user
* print_data() - prints given list values to the screen (space delimited)
* lowest_value() - returns the lowest value in the given list 
* highest_value() - returns the highest value in the given list 
* count_odds() - returns the number of odd numbers in the given list 
* sum() - returns the sum of all the values in the given list
* get_duplicate_values() - returns a list of all the values that appear multiple times in the input list

Notes: Output to the screen should only be done in main() and print_data() (and the prompt in getData).

## Sample Output

Output should be well formatted and look like this:

Enter 10 integers: 
42

-1

12

20

99

-3

42

88

99

100


You entered: 42 -1 12 20 99 -3 42 88 99 100

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lowest value:   -3	

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Highest value:  100

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # odd numbers:  4

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sum of all:     498

The following numbers appear multiple times: 42 99


## Technical Details
- Name your program list_fun.py
- Include a block at the top of your code that has your name, date, and description of the what the program does.

As with all programs written in this course, maintainability is as important as functionality, so your code should be clear and easy to follow.  Make sure it follows the class coding conventions, and double check your code against this checklist before submitting.
