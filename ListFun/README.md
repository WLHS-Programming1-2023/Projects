# List Fun - Project 5
The purpose of this assignment is to get some experience working with lists in Python

## Overview

Write a program (named list_fun) that gets 10 integers from the user, stores them in an array, and then prints out:
* the entire array
* the lowest value in the array
* the highest value in the array
* the number of odd numbers in the array
* the sum of all the values in the array.
* all the values that appear in the array more than once


## Details
You must write/use the following functions (youâ€™ll need to determine the parameter(s) and return for each): 
* get_data() - fills in given array with data entered by the user
* print_data() - prints given array values to the screen (space delimited)
* lowest_value() - returns the lowest value in the given array 
* highestValue() - returns the highest value in the given array 
* countOdds() - returns the number of odd numbers in the given array 
* sum() - returns the sum of all the values in the given array
* getDuplicateValues() - returns a list of all the values that appear multiple times in the input array

Notes: Output to the screen should only be done in main() and printData() (and the prompt in getData).

## Sample Output

Output should be well formatted and look like this:
Enter 10 integers (separated by a space): 42 -1 12 20 99 -3 42 88 99 100

You entered: 42 -1 12 20 99 -3 42 88 99 100

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lowest value:   -3	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Highest value:  100
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # odd numbers:  4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sum of all:     498

The following numbers appear multiple times: 42 99


## Technical Details
- Name your program list_fun.py
- Include a block at the top of your code that has your name, date, and description of the what the program does.

As with all programs written in this course, maintainability is as important as functionality, so your code should be clear and easy to follow.  Make sure it follows the class coding conventions, and double check your code against this checklist before submitting.
