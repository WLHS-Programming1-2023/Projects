# Geometry Fun - Project 1

The purpose of this assignment is to get some experience working with numeric data as well as demonstrating an understanding of good coding practices (writing clear, self-documenting code and following typical programming conventions).

## Overview

Write a program named GeometryFun which prompts a user for a positive whole number and outputs the following:
- The perimeter and area of a square whose side length is the entered number
- The radius, circumference, and area of a circle whose diameter is the entered number

The program will use the command line for its input and output (I/O).

## Sample Output

Output should look similar to this (assuming 7 was entered):

*Please enter a whole number: 7*

*A square with side length of 7*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *has a perimeter of 28*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *has an area of 49*

*A circle with a diameter of 7*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *has a radius of 3.5*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *has a circumference of 21.9912*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *has an area of 38.4846*


## Technical details
- PI should be declared as a constant with 5 digits of precision: 3.1416.
- User input (the whole number) should be stored in an int.
- Results of all computations should be stored in variables (donâ€™t do calculations and output at the same time).
- Program should use integer math when appropriate and floating point math when appropriate.
- The program should demonstrate the use of the tab character (\t);

As with all programs written in this course, maintainability is as important as functionality, so your code should be clear and easy to follow.  Make sure it follows the class coding conventions, and double check your code against this checklist before submitting.
